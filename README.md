# Simulating Meteor Descent and Impact üöÄüåç

This project models the descent and surface interaction of a meteor entering Earth's atmosphere. Using a physics-based approach in Python, the simulation explores how different entry angles and initial velocities affect impact behavior, bounce dynamics, and post-impact motion (e.g., rolling distance). It accounts for gravitational acceleration, atmospheric drag (air resistance), and energy loss upon impact.

## üî¨ Key Physics Features

- **Atmospheric drag**: Air resistance modeled as a velocity-dependent force, reducing terminal velocity and altering descent profiles
- **Variable entry angles**: Simulates the meteor's path from shallow to steep angles and analyzes how angle affects speed, force of impact, and post-impact motion
- **Impact physics**:
  - Checks if the meteor survives impact using a rigid-body assumption (vs. disintegrating due to excessive force)
  - Computes energy lost at impact
  - Calculates how high the meteor bounces (if it does)
  - Tracks **subsequent rolling distance** based on remaining energy
- **Descent and post-impact tracking**:
  - Time-evolution of height, speed, and acceleration
  - Impact speed and location
  - Post-impact velocity and behavior

## üìä Visual Output
Plots include:
- Descent trajectory over time
- Velocity and acceleration profiles
- Bounce height vs. impact energy
- Distance traveled on the ground post-impact
- Threshold for meteor destruction
